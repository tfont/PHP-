## PHP++

Object-oriented PHP core that is consistent, and not a framework

Let's face it, PHP is massively inconsistent. It's also profoundly backward compatible with legacy versions of PHP that are based and originated from C. This means lots of procedural functionality and conversions mixed with modern OOP conversions (most commonly camel cases). Also, not to forget the misleading and non-descriptive function naming (a lot coming from c).

### Examples

Complete readable and transparent conventions that are purely object-oriented.

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see the [complete library](dsada) index where each method (function) contains an example.
