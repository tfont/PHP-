## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Object-oriented PHP core that is consistent, and not a framework

Let's face it, PHP is massively inconsistent. It's also profoundly backward compatible with legacy versions of PHP that are based and originated from C. This means lots of procedural functionality and conversions mixed with modern OOP conversions - most commonly camel cases.

### Solution

Complete readable and transparent conventions that are purely Object-oriented.
